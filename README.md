1) have two phones/tablets connected to the same Wi-Fi network + 1 robot with IOIO

2) phone on robot: start app in IOIO mode. Select low resolution. press "start"

3) other phone/tablet: start app in control mode. Enter IP address displayed on robot phone. Press "log in"...

4) ...then press back and log back in. text to speech will not work if you do not do this (bug to be fixed)
